## Contributing to this repository

This repo is intended to demonstrate use of Embedded Swift for different applications, using Matter as an example. PRs demonstrating ways to adapt Swift's language or tooling to this application are welcome. It is not intended to be a full-featured Matter SDK so please do not raise PRs to extend the Matter Swift overlay to new areas.
